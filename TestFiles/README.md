# About TestFiles

TestFiles include various kinds of semantic files for testing and demonstrating DisGraFS, including OSH slides (in pdf), text segments (in txt and md), photos and posters (in jpg) and a short video (in mp4). These files are small enough for the Ray cluster to finish tagging in a short time (for real-time demonstration!) and they overlap in semantics, which would form an ideal graph structure among files. 

These files are encrypted for copyright reasons: OSH slides and textbooks are not to be uploaded onto the internet, and most of the photos and posters are works of the Department of Design of USTChorus. If you want to deploy DisGraFS and test it with TestFiles, you can contact us for the password. For personal use only!
